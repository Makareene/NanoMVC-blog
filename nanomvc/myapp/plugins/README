myapp/plugins

Place your application-specific plugins in this directory.

In a single-application setup (one "myapp" directory), it is fine to put all plugins in myapp/plugins and leave myfiles/plugins unused.

In a multi-application setup, shared plugins should go in myfiles/plugins, while application-specific ones should be placed in each app's myapp/plugins directory.

Do not modify anything under the sysfiles directory. It contains core framework files and may be overwritten during updates.
